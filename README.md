# firefighters

Native app for Android and iOS, I own the iOS part. 

The initial requirements were that the app the UI design should maintain the 
essence of an app that previously existed and was originally made by a freelancer some years ago.
What can be seen in github is the first prototype we made just to show how the app looks like.
The app was intended to be a way to communicate news and new regulations to 
the firefighters as well as manage work shifts and had to work in brand new iOS devices
as well as all devices still running iOS 6.
